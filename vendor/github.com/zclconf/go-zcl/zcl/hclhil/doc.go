// Package hclhil adapts Hashicorp Configuration Language and Hashicorp
// Interpolation Language (HCL and HIL, respectively) to work within the
// ZCL API.
//
// This is intended to help applications that previously used HCL/HIL to
// gradually adopt zcl while remaining generally compatible with their
// previous configuration formats.
