// Package zclsyntax contains the parser, AST, etc for zcl's native language,
// as opposed to the JSON variant and the HCL/HIL shim.
//
// In normal use applications should rarely depend on this package directly,
// instead preferring the higher-level interface of the main zcl page and
// its companion zclparse.
